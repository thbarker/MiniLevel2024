I was thinking we can try the choice chords and synth leads for dialogue choices, maybe even just 
randomize them.

There are three different versions of the music, one that's the full orchestration, one that is 
just the background stuff (probably the one to use) and the one with a bit of robot talking in the 
background just in case we need some texture.

I'm hoping to do some sound design this week for the buttons, footsteps, and screams.
